Question img
On a piece of paper, write by hand the following for-loop ten times

    ans = 0
    for i in range(10):
        ans += i

Scan or take a picture of your paper and upload it here.

ex: Once you enter explanation mode, you stay there until you start a new question:

    ans = 0
    for i in range(10):
        ans += i

    ans = 0
    for i in range(10):
        ans += i

    ans = 0
    for i in range(10):
        ans += i

    ans = 0
    for i in range(10):
        ans += i

    ans = 0
    for i in range(10):
        ans += i

    ans = 0
    for i in range(10):
        ans += i

    ans = 0
    for i in range(10):
        ans += i

    ans = 0
    for i in range(10):
        ans += i

    ans = 0
    for i in range(10):
        ans += i

    ans = 0
