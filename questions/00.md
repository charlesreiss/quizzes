title: Math knowledge pre-quiz
hours: 0
comments: true
directions: This "quiz" has two goals: first, to help me determine if there is some of the math review I am planning to include that I can skip instead; and second, to give you a no-points practice quiz.  It is not included in your grade, and as such working with others on it is permitted.



Question mmc
Which of the following mathematical terms are you comfortable enough with that I could use them without definition?
